Raw value smoothing

The calibration is very sensitive to noise; currently, it takes a single
raw value sample for each of the calibration points, and uses those value
to calculate the calibration values.

We need to take more than one raw value for each calibration point: we need
a filter.

There are a few options for the filter:

* Moving average filter

* Recursive (IIR) filter



Moving average filter
=====================

A moving average filter is easy to implement and understand, and works
well with integer arithmetic. It provides very good performance in 
the time domain (noise is reduced, but step response is still good), 
but poor frequency domain response. For weight measurement, we are not
interested in the frequency characteristics of the signal.

Integer overlow can be a problem, especially if the filter is long. Also,
a numnber of sample points have to be stored and managed; this can be
relatively timeconsuming.



Recursive filter

A simple one- or two-pole IIR filter is easy to implement. However, it is
more difficult to
